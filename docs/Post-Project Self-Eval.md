## ðŸŽ¯ Scoring Strategy:
* **90â€“100%** â†’ You built it independently, solved bugs, and fully understood the internals
* **70â€“89%** â†’ You followed guidance or needed hints but understood it well
* **50â€“69%** â†’ You needed help, partial understanding, revisit with mini drills
* **Below 50%** â†’ Weak zone, revisit with a focused set of problems

| ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------- |
| Did I complete the project fully runnable?       |                   |
| Did I debug & test multiple use cases myself?    |                   |
| Can I explain why I used each data structure?    |                   |
| Did I reuse code/logic smartly across features?  |                   |
| Could I add a new feature without fear?          |                   |
| Did I hit all parts of Sprint 1 + 2 in practice? |                   |
